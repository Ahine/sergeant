Description: 'Apache Drill' is a low-latency distributed query engine designed to enable 
    data exploration and analytics on both relational and non-relational datastores, 
    scaling to petabytes of data. Methods are provided that enable working with 'Apache Drill'
    instances via the 'REST API' or the JDBC interface. Also has an experimental 'dplyr' interface.
